When I read this passage in _Harry Potter_, what came to my mind was that this could be a way of innovation: thinking deeply, extracting meaningful information, and putting it together. Observing carefully to discover patterns and connections. 

NotebookLM seems to be a product that does exactly this, and I want to build one too.

>'This? It is called a Pensieve,' said Dumbledore.' I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.'
>
>'Er,' said Harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort.
>
>'At these times,' said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin,' I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.

>Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing across the room, every now and then placing his wand tip to his temple, and adding another shining, silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve.
