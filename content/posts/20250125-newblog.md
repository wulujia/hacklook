This is my first time writing a blog in English. Although I’ve been writing for over 20 years, it has always been in my native language.

From now on, I’ll aim to write something on this blog every week. Sometimes, I’ll write in my native language and use tools like ChatGPT and DeepL Writer to translate it into English. Other times, I’ll write directly in English to practice.

I’ve decided to use Hugo to build my blog, and I’m publishing my writing on GitHub. Let’s get started.
