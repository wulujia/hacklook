My colleague gave me a boxâ€”it's a SUSS project called _Come! Let's Chat_. It's a beautifully made box containing cards, photos, and other materials. The elderly can use this toolbox to play a mini-game that helps improve their social skills and build friendships.

Here are my thoughts:

- It could be more cost-effective to use a printer to print all the materials.
- The project could be open-source, with all resources available on the web and GitHub so that everyone can use and improve it.
- The game could be made simpler. For example, we could remove the complicated colors and pucks and instead use a die to decide who draws a card by counting the numbers.
